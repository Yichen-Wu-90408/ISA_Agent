\section{Completion of financing targets}
According to the project data on Icodrops (nearly one year) we obtained, there are currently $v1_1$ projects. Among these $v1_1$ projects, $v1_2$ projects have completed their financing targets, accounting for $v1_3$, $v1_4$ projects did not complete their financing targets, accounting for $v1_5$, and the remaining $v1_6$ projects did not set financing targets, accounting for $v1_7$.

\section{Total financing amount (monthly)}
From the data in the figure, we can see that in the last $v3_1$ months, $v3_2$ has the largest monthly financing amount and $v3_3$ has the least monthly financing amount. The difference between the two is $v3_4$. The three months with the highest financing amount are $v3_5$ ($v3_6$), $v3_7$ ($v3_8$), $v3_9$ ($v3_10$).

\section{Distribution of financing amount}
From the recent (one year) project financing data we obtained on Icodrops, we can see that among all the projects involved in financing, there are $v2_1$ projects with a financing amount of less than 1 million US dollars, accounting for $v2_2$, the amount of project financing between US\$1 million and US\$3 million is $v2_3$, accounting for $v2_4$; $v2_5$ projects' financing amounts are between US\$3 million and US\$5 million, accounting for $v2_6$; $v2_7$ project financing The amount is between US\$5 million and US\$10 million, accounting for $v2_8$; $v2_9$ projects with financing amount exceeding US\$10 million, accounting for $v2_10$.

\section{Token usage}
From the data in the figure below, we can see that in the past $v3_1$ months, most of the projects were used for ``$v4_1$'', the total financing amount was $v4_2$, accounting for $v4_3$, followed by that for ``$v4_4$'', the total financing is $v4_5$, the proportion is $v4_6$.

\section{Need KYC or not}
Among all the above projects, $v5_1$ projects require kyc to be financed, accounting for $v5_2$; and $v5_3$ projects can participate in financing without kyc, accounting for $v5_4$.
